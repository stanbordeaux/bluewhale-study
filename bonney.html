<h1>The Bonney Upwelling</h1>

    <p>Every year in October-November, weather patterns across southern Australia change - high pressure systems move south, bringing fresh south-east winds to the continental shelf off western Victoria and south-east South Australia. </p>
    <p>These winds drift the surface water offshore, replacing it with cold, nutrient-rich water which wells up from the deep Southern Ocean. This coastal upwelling is the richest in Australian waters, and is known as the <strong><a href="bonney_sat.html">Bonney Upwelling</a></strong>. </p>
    <p>It is part of a larger upwelling system that extends from western Bass Strait to the eastern Great Australian Bight.</p>
    <p>The nutrients brought to the surface by the upwelling stimulate massive blooms of phytoplankton that support a variety and richness of marine life that is unparalleled in the generally poor Australian marine environment. </p>
    <p>One of the most important invertebrates in this system is the krill (<em>Nyctiphanes australis)</em>, a dweller in shallow shelf waters. Forming swarms of millions, they often occur in red-brown masses at the surface. </p>
    <p>Krill is at the centre of a food web which includes fish, squid, gannets, albatrosses, shearwaters, prions, seals, sharks, sunfish, sea turtles, bottlenose and common dolphins, and whales: sperm whales, pilot whales, beaked whales, orcas, minke whales, sei whales, fin whales and blue whales. Of these whale species, astonishingly, the most commonly seen species is the blue whale. </p>
    <p>The research, conducted by <strong><a href="about.html">Dr Peter Gill</a></strong> and PhD candidate, <strong><a href="about.html">Margie Morrice</a></strong>, examines the links between the blue whales and their upwelling environment. By looking at the blue whale feeding habitat, ecology and behaviour at varying scales, the researchers hope to understand the whales' relationship to their dynamic habitat, and the ways in which they locate and secure their food.</p>
