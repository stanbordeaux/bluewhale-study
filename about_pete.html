    <p><strong>Research summary: </strong>Pete&rsquo;s main research interest since 1998 is the ecology of Endangered blue whales (<em>Balaenoptera musculus</em>) in the Bonney Upwelling and surrounding waters of south-east Australia. His Ph.D. (<em>Ecological linkages within the Bonney Upwelling blue whale feeding area</em>), awarded through Deakin University in 2004, focused on the dynamic linkages between weather, oceanography, prey and blue whales in this region, using aerial and boat surveys, satellite remote sensing and deployed oceanographic instruments to demonstrate that these waters are an important seasonal feeding aggregation area for blue whales. This work has progressed into description and modelling of blue whale feeding habitat in this region. Through collaboration with the Australian Antarctic Division and the Centre for Whale Research (W.A.), Pete has also studied movements of blue whales by satellite tagging, with the dual aims of discovering patterns of movement in the summer feeding area, and where the whales migrate to during the winter breeding season. This innovative program has had its share of technical difficulties, and so far the whales&rsquo; winter migration patterns remain elusive.&nbsp; With colleagues from Cascadia Research (USA), Margie and Pete have studied fine-scale foraging behaviour of blue whales using suction-cup-attached dive loggers. They are also involved in a project aimed at unraveling the population genetics of Southern Hemisphere blue whales with Macquarie and Flinders Universities, and in ongoing photo-identification (photo-ID) of individual whales. Photo-ID enables us to understand important aspects of whales&rsquo; lives including movements between areas (we exchange our images with those of other researchers elsewhere), patterns of residency (how long whales remain in feeding areas, and whether they return over multiple seasons), associations between individudal whales, and the health condition of the whales. Pete and Margie have also become increasingly involved in assessing the impacts of offshore seismic surveys and other human acitivies on blue and other whales. </p>
    <p><strong>Research interests: </strong>Blue whale ecology and migration; upwelling dynamics and climate change; blue whale habitat modelling; interactions between cetaceans and offshore industrial activities. </p>
    <p><strong>Biography: </strong>After an earlier working life in the Australian bush, Pete Gill became involved in whale research and deepwater sailing in 1983. For many years he assisted Dr Bill Dawbin, the &lsquo;grandfather&rsquo; of humpback whale research, before branching out into his own studies of humpback migration, using small sailing vessels in the Coral Sea, around New Caledonia, and off the coast of Tasmania and Antarctica during the 1990s. During 1990-91 he worked as Marine Mammal Researcher for Greenpeace Australia, endeavouring to build bridges between scientists, commercial fishers and environmentalists. During the early-to-mid-1990s Pete also worked in a Sydney University research program on southern right whales at the Head of Bight (South Australia) and in Western Australia. During 1989 he skippered the 20m schooner <em>A.V. Thistlethwayte </em>in the Oceanic Research Foundation&rsquo;s <em>In the Wake of Flinders</em> circumnavigation of Australia. For many years he worked as a home handyman and part-time writer and photographer to support his research activities.</p>
<p>He has visited Antarctica 13 times: on private sailing expeditions including <em>Riquita&rsquo;s</em> voyage to the Ross Sea in 1986, the Mount Minto Ross Sea Expedition in 1988, and the <em>Iniquity</em> whale survey in 1993; on whale surveys aboard the Australian government icebreaker <em>Aurora Australis</em>; and as a lecturer, boat driver and guide on Antarctic tourist expeditions &nbsp;with Aurora Expeditions, to the Ross Sea and East Antarctica. </p>
<p>Pete lives in the bush east of Portland, Victoria, with his wife Susie, near the Bonney Upwelling and the blue whales. In 2005 he sailed to the Solomon Islands in an unsuccessful attempt to locate blue whale winter breeding grounds, and is currently planning future expeditions to locate other blue whale aggregation areas. With Margie Morrice he consults on blue whales to State and Commonwealth Governments, and to offshore industry which operates in the whale feeding area. </p>
    <p>He is the author of <em>Reader&rsquo;s Digest Explores Whales, Dolphins and Porpoises</em> (with Linda Gibson), the <em>Nature Company Guide to Whales, Dolphins and Porpoises</em> (with Mark Carwardine, Erich Hoyt and Ewan Fordyce), <em>Whale Watching in Australian and New Zealand Waters </em>(with Cecilia Burke) and many scientific papers, book chapters and magazine articles. His photographs have appeared in many books, and he has lectured on whales, whaling and Antarctica.</p>
