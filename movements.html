  <h1>Long range movements</h1>
    <p>Blue whales are known as &lsquo;long-legged&rsquo; whales; they are adapted for fast long-range movements between different feeding areas. We are starting to accumulate evidence from a variety of research methods, which supports this developing picture of these giant ocean wanderers. </p>
   <p> Until 2003 our work focused on the continental shelf between Cape Otway in western Bass Strait, Victoria, and Robe, SA. In late 2003 and 2005, our aerial surveys found blue whales feeding nearly 500km west of the core feeding area. This &lsquo;new&rsquo; feeding area was west and south of Kangaroo Island in the eastern Great Australian Bight, the western extremity of a large-scale upwelling system that includes the Bonney Upwelling. At this stage it seems that blue whales only use this western area in any numbers during December. </p>
   <p>
    Photo-identification of individuals has shown a resight in the Bonney Upwelling in 2005 of a blue whale photograpically identified in the Perth Canyon, Western Australia, in 2004. This was the first evidence that the blue whales using the Bonney Upwelling may move between it and other feeding areas, and we expect many more resights in future as our photo-ID collection grows.</p>
   <p>
    In April 2005, satellite tagging showed direct movement of a blue whale south from the Bonney Upwelling to the Sub-Tropical Convergence, a broad oceanic mixing zone to Australia&rsquo;s south where Soviet whalers illegally killed many blue whales during the 1960s. </p>
   <p>
    All this evidence suggests that these whales are part of a larger 'open' population, rather than being restricted only to the Bonney Upwelling. </p>
   <p>
    In future we will increase our focus on photo-identification, so that we can use mark-recapture methods to estimate numbers of blue whales using this habitat. We also hope to carry out more satellite tagging studies, hopefully to learn the whales&rsquo; migration routes as they head north to winter breeding grounds in the tropics. In 2005 we conducted an expedition to the Solomon Islands (where blue whales have been sighted in the past) aboard the sailing catamaran SV <em>Pelican 1 </em>(<a href="http://www.svpelican.com.au"><strong>www.svpelican.com.au</strong></a><strong>)</strong>, which was unsuccessful due to sustained bad weather.<strong> </strong>We have since received fresh reports of blue whales in that region, and also want to investigate the Sub-tropical Convergence to our south, so further expeditions lie ahead. <p>
