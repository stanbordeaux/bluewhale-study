<h1>The Bonney Blue</h1>


<img src = "<?=base_url();?>images/bonney_blue.jpg" class="floatRight">
    <p>In February 2007, the Blue Whale Study acquired a new 6.3m research vessel, the <em>Bonney Blue, </em>funded largely by Santos Ltd, that allows us to work independently at sea.&nbsp; </p>

    <p>The <em>Bonney Blue</em> is a plate aluminium Razerline Olympian&trade;, built by Seaquest Boats in Perth, WA, and fitted out by Geelong Boating Centre. She is designed as an offshore&nbsp; fishing vessel, suitable to our needs due to her rugged construction, excellent sea-handling qualities, and weatherproof walk-around wheelhouse. She is powered by fuel-efficient twin Yamaha F80 four-stroke outboards, has extended-range fuel tanks, and we navigate using a Furuno GP-7000F plotter-sounder. For safety she carries comprehensive Pains-Wessex distress equipment, and ICOM VHF radio. &nbsp;</p>

    <p>Modifications include: 

    <ol>

      <li>Extra-high bow rails that enable a tagger or photographer to brace securely in the bow. </li>

      <li>A drum winch on the starboard side aft, for deployment of our Seabird SBE-19&trade; CTD (temperature and salinity at depth instrument). We are considering replacing it with a pot-hauler-type winch that would allow a more versatile range of deployments. </li>

      <li>A custom-made fitting on the port side that enables us to raise or lower our Simrad&trade; krill-finding sounder transducer. </li>

    </ol></p>

    <p>The boat is used for a range of scientific methods, including: </p>

    <ol>

      <li>photo-identification of blue and other whales, for studying movements, long-term residence patterns and associations of individual whales. </li>

      <li>behavioural studies of foraging and feeding blue and other whales, as well as other social interactions possibly related to breeding etc. </li>

      <li>tagging of blue and other whales using suction-cup-attached tags which will enable us to study fine-scale foraging and feeding movements; as well as implanted satellite tags, which will enable us to study larger-scale migratory and foraging movements.</li>

      <li>behavioural studies involving experimental exposure of blue whales to seismic airgun sounds. </li>

      <li>biopsy sampling of blue and other whales for genetic studies on whale populations and social relationships. </li>

      <li>net sampling of whale prey (for species ID), whale faeces (for prey genetic studies), and sloughed whale skin (for whale genetic studies).</li>

      <li>oceanographic sampling using CTD (records temperature-salinity at depth), moored temperature loggers and other instruments. </li>

      <li>hydroacoustic sampling using a towed transducer (echo-sounder) for measuring acoustic backscatter of whale prey ie krill. </li>

      <li>acoustic monitoring using hydrophones and sonobuoys to study whale acoustic behaviour. </li>

      <li>recording the presence and behaviour of a range of other species including seabirds, seals, fish etc etc. </li>

      <li>generally monitoring environmental conditions and human-related threats in the blue whale feeding grounds.<br />

    <p>She is also an excellent fishing boat!</p>
