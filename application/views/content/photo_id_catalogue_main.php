<h1>Photo Identification</h1>

    <p>Using photographs taken of blue whales in the Bonney Upwelling since 1998, Margie and Pete are developing a database of identified individuals. Animals are identified by distinct mottled pigment markings across their bodies. Blue whale mottling, like human fingerprints, are unique to each individual. The shape of blue whales&rsquo; dorsal fins is also highly variable, so the combination of mottling pattern and dorsal fin shape is usually enough to identify an individual. We try to photograph the flank of the animal in front of the dorsal fin, with the fin in the frame for reference. Images are then matched by eye to other photographs within the database to establish either a new unique animal, or a resight.</p>

    <p> This is a very slow process as whale markings can appear different under different lighting conditions, so we must be careful. Resights, or matches, must be agreed on by at least three researchers before they are accepted. Within a field season and between years, this process provides insights into which individuals are repeatedly seen in the Bonney Upwelling. In addition, specific information from each individual can be catalogued, providing more detail and a context to successive sightings. </p><p>Pete and Margie's photo-identification work is not carried out alone. Collaboration between the Blue Whale Study, West Australian researchers Curt and Micheline Jenner (<a href="http://www.cwr.org.au/"><strong>Centre for Whale Research</strong></a>), Chris Burton (Western Whale) and other Southern Hemisphere researchers, will lead to an increase in numbers of individuals being identified in both regions. So far we have a single resight with Western Australia, evidence of movement across the entire south coast of Australia. Given the existing lack of knowledge on many aspects of blue whale ecology, such findings are important in establishing habitat use, interactions between whales, and long range movements.</p>
