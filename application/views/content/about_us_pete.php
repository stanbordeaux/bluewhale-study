    <p><strong>Research summary: </strong>Pete&rsquo;s main research interest since 1998 is the ecology of Endangered blue whales (<em>Balaenoptera musculus</em>) in the Bonney Upwelling and surrounding waters of south-east Australia. His Ph.D. (<em>Ecological linkages within the Bonney Upwelling blue whale feeding area</em>), awarded through Deakin University in 2004, focused on the dynamic linkages between weather, oceanography, prey and blue whales in this region, using aerial and boat surveys, satellite remote sensing and deployed oceanographic instruments to demonstrate that these waters are an important seasonal feeding aggregation area for blue whales. This work has progressed into description and modelling of blue whale feeding habitat in this region.</p>

    <p><strong>Research interests: </strong>Blue whale ecology and migration; upwelling dynamics and climate change; blue whale habitat modelling; interactions between cetaceans and offshore industrial activities. </p>
    <p><strong>Biography: </strong>After an earlier working life in the Australian bush, Pete Gill became involved in whale research and deepwater sailing in 1983. For many years he assisted Dr Bill Dawbin, the ‘grandfather’ of humpback whale research, before branching out into his own studies of humpback migration, using small sailing vessels in the Coral Sea, around New Caledonia, and off the coast of Tasmania during the 1990s. During 1990-91 he worked as Marine Mammal Researcher for Greenpeace Australia, while continuing humpback whale research. During the early-to-mid-1990s Pete also worked in a Sydney University
    research program on southern right whales at the Head of Bight (South Australia) and in Western Australia. During 1989 he skippered the 20m schooner A.V. Thistlethwayte in the Oceanic Research Foundation’s In the Wake of Flinders circumnavigation of Australia. For many years he worked as a home handyman and part-time writer and photographer to support his research and expedition activities.</p>
    <p>He has visited Antarctica 13 times: on private sailing expeditions including Riquita’s voyage to the Ross Sea in 1986, the Mount Minto Bicentennial Expedition in 1988, and the Iniquity whale survey in 1993; on whale surveys aboard the Australian government icebreaker Aurora  Australis; and as a lecturer, boat driver and guide on Antarctic tourist expeditions with Aurora Expeditions, to the Ross Sea and East Antarctica. </p>    
    <p>Pete started the Blue Whale Study in 1998, and was joined by Margie in 2000. He lives in the bush near Portland, Victoria with his wife Susie, close to the Bonney Upwelling and the blue whales. </p>
    <p>In 2005 he sailed to the Solomon Islands in an unsuccessful attempt to locate blue whale winter breeding grounds, and is currently planning future expeditions to locate other blue whale aggregation areas. With Margie he consults on blue whales to State and Commonwealth Governments, and to offshore industry which operates in the whale feeding area. </p>
    <p>He is the author of Reader’s  Digest  Explores Whales, Dolphins and Porpoises (with Linda Gibson), the Nature Company Guide to Whales, Dolphins and Porpoises (with Mark Carwardine, Erich Hoyt and Ewan Fordyce), Whale Watching in Australian and New Zealand Waters (with Cecilia Burke) and many scientific papers, book chapters and magazine articles. His photographs have appeared in many books, and he has lectured on whales, whaling and Antarctica.</p>
