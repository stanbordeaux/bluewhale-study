<h1>Blue Whales in South Eastern Australian Waters</h1>

    <p>Since 1998 the Blue Whale Study has been investigating the ecology of blue whales (<em>Balaenoptera musculus</em>), the largest animal on Earth, in their feeding habitat in waters off south-west Victoria and south-east South Australia. The Blue Whale Study, conducted by whale ecologists <a href="http://www.bluewhalestudy.com.au/about.html"><strong>Dr Peter Gill</strong></a><strong> </strong>and <a href="http://www.bluewhalestudy.com.au/about.html"><strong>Margie Morrice</strong></a>, has unraveled and described the fundamental ecology&nbsp; underlying the&nbsp; presence of blue whales in this feeding area.</p>
<p>Every November south-easterly winds bring to life one of Australia&rsquo;s most remarkable oceanic phenomena, cold-water upwelling along the continental shelf between north-west Tasmania and the Great Australian Bight. The upwelling has become best&nbsp; known as the <a href="http://www.bluewhalestudy.com.au/bonney.html"><strong>Bonney Upwelling</strong></a>, which is actually the area of most intense upwelling between Portland, Victoria and Robe, South Australia. The entire upwelling area is perhaps the most productive marine region around Australia, and supports vast quantities of krill <em>Nyctiphanes australis</em>. It is the presence of the krill during the upwelling season that makes this an abundant feeding ground for blue whales. The whales arrive from their winter breeding areas in tropical waters in November and spread out to feed along the continental shelf , until May. The upwelling area is one of only three known coastal blue whale feeding areas in the Southern Hemisphere, outside Antarctica. The others are off Fremantle, Western Australia, and off the coast of Chile, South America. </p>
<p>
Blue whales can be up to 32m long, weigh over 150 tonnes and eat over 5 tonnes of krill per day. In the Bonney Upwelling we believe that most blue whales are &lsquo;pygmy&rsquo; blues (<em>Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda</em>), a Southern Hemisphere sub-species that reaches about 25m. All blue whales are Endangered under Australian law. </p>
<p>
While the main business of Blue Whale Study is scientific research on the whales and their habitat, we are also developing an education and monitoring program to raise awareness of the&nbsp; blue whales and their habitat, locally, nationally and internationally. Pete and Margie hope their work will assist in protecting whales and their recovery from the devastating effects of 20th century whaling, and that the whales&rsquo; oceanic feeding habitat can be maintained for future generations of both whales and humans. </p>
