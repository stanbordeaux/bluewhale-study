  <p>The <em>Bonney Blue</em>, our new research vessel</p>
  </div>
  <div id="mainContent">
<h1>News &amp; Media</h1>

    <p><strong>February 2007: Our new research vessel, Bonney Blue</strong></p>
    <p> In February 2007 we were able to purchase our own research vessel. Bonney Blue is a 6.5m plate aluminium Razerline Olympian offshore fishing vessel, powered by twin Yamaha 80hp 4-stroke outboards, and equipped with a full suite of safety equipment. Bonney Blue&nbsp; is very strong and seaworthy, and allows us to operate independently anywhere along the upwelling coast. She is fitted out with a custom-made extra-high bow railing for whale tagging and photography; an electric winch for deploying our CTD (temperature, salinity &amp; depth probe); and&nbsp; a custom-made mounting for Margie&rsquo;s scientific depth sounder. All in all she is a handy little ship that allows us to carry out a wide range of research activities at minimal cost. We were able to purchase the boat with support from Santos Ltd and others who prefer to remain anonymous. </p>
    <p><strong> March 2007: Suction-cup tagging research</strong></p>
    <p> In March 2007 we were joined by our colleagues John Calambokidis and Greg Schorr of Cascadia Research Collective of Olympia, Washington, to conduct a program of attaching suction-cup dive loggers to study the foraging and feeding behaviour of blue whales. John and Greg are acknowledged as foremost specialists in the attachment of these tags, and we developed a great working relationship with them. This work is central to Margie&rsquo;s Ph.D. on blue whale foraging behaviour, and allowed us to record the feeding dives of blue whales in three dimensions, overcoming the huge limitation that we normally have: that the movements of whales are invisible to us once they dive. We were able to tag seven blue whales, including a male-female pair for the first time. The tagging data, when analysed together with Margie&rsquo;s krill hydroacoustic (sonar) data and temperature and salinity at various depths, will enable us to relate blue whale foraging behaviour to their upwelling habitat and their prey, krill. Margie&rsquo;s work is focusing at the fine scale&nbsp; of individual whale behaviour, while Pete&rsquo;s work has mainly focused on the bigger picture of whale distribution and ecology across the whole feeding area. </p>
    <p><strong> November-December 2007: Cape Town marine mammal conference</strong></p>
    <p> Margie and Pete both went to the Biennial Conference on the Biology of Marine Mammals, the largest marine mammal conference in the world, held this time in Cape Town, South Africa. The conference was a great opportunity to meet or re-connect with others working in our field, and to hear the latest research from around the world. A Blue Whale Workshop was a special feature of the conference for us, bringing together for the first time almost all the blue whale researchers from around the globe. </p>
    <p><strong> January 2009: Blue Whale Study Inc. legal status</strong></p>
    <p> In October 2007 the Blue Whale Study, which had previously been conducted under the name of Australocetus Research, was registered with Consumer Affairs Victoria as an Incorporated Association, Blue Whale Study Inc., and Australocetus Research was dissolved. </p>
    <p> In December 2008, Blue Whale Study Inc. gained Approved Research Institute status from the Australian Taxation Office. This enabled us to successfully apply for both Tax Deductible Gift Recipient and Charity status, which were granted in January 2009. This status is not easily gained and the privileges that go with it, including the ability to receive tax-deductible gifts and claim other benefits, are of huge value for the future of a small independent organisation such as Blue Whale Study Inc. </p>
    <p><strong> March-April 2009: Biopsy and photo-ID research</strong></p>
    <p> This year we continued a partnership we began two years ago with Dr Luciana M&ouml;ller of Macquarie University (now Flinders University). Luciana is a blue whale geneticist who is trying to unravel the mysteries of blue whale population genetics in the Southern Hemisphere: are the blue whales in the Bonney Upwelling pygmy blues? Are they genetically similar to blue whales that feed off Perth? Do Antarctic blue whales occasionally feed here? Can pygmy and Antarctic blue whales be genetically distinguished from each other? </p>
    <p> Luciana was unable to come this year but her students Cat Attard, Jo Wiesniewski and Ana Amaral joined us for two weeks in March and April. The weather was relatively kind to us and allowed us to get out to sea on five days, during which we collected 11 blue whale biopsy samples, and 19 common dolphin samples, for a dolphin population study. </p>
    <p> We also continued to collect photo-ID data at every opportunity, with about 25 new blue whales added to our photo-ID catalogue, with much help from Deb Glasgow. As this catalogue grows, we will learn more about the habits of individual whales in the Bonney Upwelling, and by exchcanging our catalogue with other researchers in Western Australia and overseas, we will learn more about the whales&rsquo; movements between regions. Already we have one match between the Perth Canyon and the Bonney Upwelling, and expect to find more in future. Finding time to collate and analyse our photo-ID catalogue is a major headache for us as it requires time and funding, which is scarce. </p>
    <p><strong> April 2009: Caring for Blue Whale Country grant successful</strong></p>
    <p> Last year we applied for funding under the Commonwealth&rsquo;s Caring for Country scheme, to initiate a program of community education, training and participation in blue whale monitoring and conservation. This would expand considerably on the low-key program of school and community talks that we have been involved in for years (on a voluntary basis). After some delay we learned in April that we had been successful to the tune of about $40,000, which has to be spent over the next 18 months. This will enable to expand on our research program by communicating our research findings to the community at large, by involving diverse school and community groups in talks and training sessions, in which they can learn where and when to look for blue whales, how to interpret their behaviour, and how to drive vessels near whales etc. We will also be producing educational material including posters and leaflets, as well as upgrading our website to include more interactive components that will allow young people in particular to engage with the world of blue whales online. </p>
    <p> While we are excited about the Caring for Blue Whale Country grant, we are still seeking funding to continue our core business, blue whale research. </p>
    <p><strong> June 2009: genetic and photo-ID study</strong></p>
    <p> At the Blue Whale Workshop in Cape Town in late 2007, the Blue Whale Study joined a consortium of researchers to develop a plan for a joint program of combined photo-ID and biopsy of blue whales in Australian waters, to contribute to understanding the status of Southern Hemisphere blue whale populations. We submitted an application for Commonwealth funding through the Australian Marine Mammal Centre, and have recently learned that our bid was successful. This will enable us to continue our photo-ID and biopsy program over the next three years. </p>
